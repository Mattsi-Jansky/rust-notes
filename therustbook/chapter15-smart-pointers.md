# Chapter 15: Smart Pointers

* A pointer is a variable that contains an address in memory
* _Smart pointers_ act like pointers but also have additional metadata and capabilities
  * Rust implements various smart pointers in the standard library
  * Typically, in Rust a smart pointer owns the data it refers to
  * `String` and `Vec<T>` are smart pointers- they own the data they reference and provide metadata like length
* Smart pointers are typically implemented using `Struct`s
  * They are distinguished from ordinary structs by the `Deref` and `Drop` traits
    * `Drop` allows you to add a hook method that gets called when the variable drops out of scope
    * `Deref` allows an instance of the smart pointer to "behave like a reference"? Unclear what this means, more detail in following chapters

## Using Box<T> to Point to Data on the Heap

* `Box` allows you to store data on the heap, rather than the stack. Stack stores a reference to heap data.
  * So it turns what would have been a primitive into a pointed value instead? This is boxing. Suddenly makes sense why it's called `Box`
* Use box when...
  * Type whose size can't be known at compile time, and you need to know the exact size at run-time
  * Large amount of data, want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won't be copied/cloned when you do
    * Frequently transferring a large amount of data on the stack impacts performance
  * You want to own a value, but only care that it's a type that implements a particular trait rather than a specific type
    * Trait object, coverd in chapter 17
* Using Box: `Box::new(5)`
* Size of  _recursive type_ can't be known at runtime
  * Anything that can store another value of the same type inside itself- ie a tree or list
  * Because that recursion could continue infinitely, Rust doesn't know how much space to allocate it. Therefore, it must be stored on the heap.
* Cons list example
  * Const list data structure comes from Lisp.
  * Like a tuple whose second value is always the same type as the tuple- so you construct a new container containing a value, and another container
  * Last container has a value of "Nil" (Canonical name within the context of the datastruct, not nil as in Rust)
* When allocating size for an enum, Rust takes the size of the biggest variant
* Attempting to naively implement cons list gives `recursive type `List` has infinite size` error.
  * Can't figure out the maximum size of the enum because it's recursive
* This can be fixed by using `Box`- turns it into a linked list instead of a recursive self-reference

## Deref Trait

* Deref allows a struct to use the _dereference operator_ (`*`, it returns the referenced value- think it also consumes the reference) 
* `Box<T>` can be used as a reference: ```fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = Box::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}```

## Running Code on Cleanup with the Drop Trait

* Allows you to close streams as an object is killed, similar to dispose in Java/Csharp
* > For example, when a Box<T> is dropped it will deallocate the space on the heap that the box points to.
  * Why? If you do nothing the inner variables in `Box<T>` will be disposed of once they are out of scope (ie when the `Box<T>` is dropped), so why does it need to do anything when it is dropped? Maybe they're using some unsafe code that works differently?
* call `std::mem::drop ` to destruct/drop a variable forcefully
  * This may partially answer the question above- presumably this is _how_ they do it but still not clear on _why_

## Rc<T>, the reference counted smart pointer

* There are times when an object can have multiple owners
  * Explains with graphs: Imagine multiple nodes pointing to the same value, all thinking that they own it. Shouldn't be cleaned up until all nodes are dropped.
  * I think what they mean is that _conceptually_ in programming in general an object can have multiple owners; not that it can happen in Rust. `Rc<T>` must be a smart pointer that enables you to do that while still maintaining Rust's ownership system, such that `Rc<T>` is the owner of the inner value.
* Only for use single-threaded
* > We use the Rc<T> type when we want to allocate some data on the heap for multiple parts of our program to read and we canâ€™t determine at compile time which part will finish using the data last.
* Create the new instance of `Rc::new`, then clone it as many times as necessary with `Rc::clone`


## RefCell<T> and the Interior Mutability Pattern

* Interior mutability pattern- objects acts as immutable reference to the outside consumer, but internally uses `unsafe` code to mutate itself.
  * `unsafe` is used when because we can guarantee that the borrow rules will be followed in run-time even when the compiler can't
* `RefCell<T>` will observe borrow rules during run-time instead of compile time- if you use it in the wrong way you'll get run-time errors instead of compile errors
* `RefCell<T>` is not threadsafe, similar to `Rc<T>`
* "you can mutate the value inside the RefCell<T> even when the RefCell<T> is immutable." - this seems weird to me. "Immutable" isn't the right phrase here, if you can mutate it then it isn't immutable.
* Use `borrow_mut` on ` RefCell<T>` to get a mutable ref to the inner value
* Example of usecase: Mocking a struct that is used as a reference
  * You want to record the behaviours used against the struct, while enabling the consumer to treat it as if it were a regular immutable reference
* `RefCell<T>` returns `Ref` and `MutRef` types that act as references/mutable references, implementing `Deref`
* If you violate borrowing rules with a `RefCell<T>`, you get a `panic!` in run-time
* You can also get multiple mutable references by making a `Rc<RefCell<T>>`- that way you can clone the smart pointer and get multiple smart pointers to the same area of memory
  * The book didn't seem to highlight how dangerous and how much of a bad idea this is

## Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory

* Rust doesn't guarantee safety against memory leaks, though they can only occur if you are doing something unusual.
* One unusual thing that can cause memory leaks: `RefCell<Rc<T>>` can leak if you have two that refer to one another. Then their reference counts will never reach 0 (so will never be dropped) because they always have a reference.
* To avoid creating cyclic references use `Rc::downgrade` instead of `Rc::clone`, returning a `WEAK<T>` REFERENCE TYPE
  * Weak references don't add to the count when checking for usages before droppign the value
  * Weak references don't express an ownership relationship
  * To do anything with a `Weak<T>` instance you must call `upgrade` which will return an `Option` with the `Rc<T>` value if it exists
* Eg to implement a tree this way each node would own their children and each child would have a `RefCell<Weak<T>>` reference to their parent.
